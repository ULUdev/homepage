# Homepage
## Description
This Repository contains the files necessary to run my homepage.
## Dependencies
In order to build it and deploy it you need:
- `make`
- `sassc`
- (`rsweb` is the server I use to view the website. Any server works with the
  right configuration for that matter)
To build the style sheets just run `make`. If you need to rebuild the style
sheets use `make -B`.

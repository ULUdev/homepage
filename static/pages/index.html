      <p>
	I'm a 15 year old high school student from Germany who loves math and
	programming. I have a decent amount of experience with git, GitHub and
	GitLab. My programming languages of choice are C and Rust, allthough my
	knowledge also dips into Python, javascript and a little lisp. For this
	website I explored the topic of frontend frameworks a little bit and
	settled on <a href="http://lit.dev">lit</a>. I recently took a course at
	the University of Greifswald on Theoretical Computer Science and passed
	the exam.

      <p>
	I'm 15 years old and I live in Germany. I like maths and programming in
	my free time. I am familiar with a good amount of tools used in the
	industry such as git, GitHub, Make and others. My programming languages
	of choice are: C and Rust. I also know at least enough web technologies
	to make this website. I recently took a course at university on theoretical
	computer science and passed the exam.
